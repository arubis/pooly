# Pooly

Implementation of Pooly (similar to [Poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy)) from [_The Little Elixir & OTP Handbook_](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook).

Intent is to pass through each iteration from the book, then refactor into Elixir 1.5-styled module supervisors.
Progress tracked in `Pooly.org`.

I'm not doing anything fancy with Hex or ExDoc here, so don't expect them to generate usable installations/documentation.
